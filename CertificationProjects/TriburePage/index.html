            Despite covering a far greater distance than any other lead dogs on
            the run, over some of the most dangerous parts of the trail, his
            role was left out of contemporary news of the event at the time, in
            favor of the lead dog for the last leg of the relay,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balto">Balto</a>, whom
