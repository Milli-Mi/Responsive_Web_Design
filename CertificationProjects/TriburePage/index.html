          <h1>Togo (dog)</h1>
          <p>
            Togo was the true hero dog of the serum run. Despite covering a far
            greater distance than any other lead dogs on the run, over some of
            the most dangerous parts of the trail, his role was left out of
            contemporary news of the event at the time, in favor of the lead dog
            for the last leg of the relay, Balto, whom Seppala also owned and
            had bred.

          <p>Though Balto received the credit for saving the town, to those who know more than the Disney story, Balto is considered the backup dog. <span class="bold">Balto ran 55 miles, while Togo's leg of the journey was the longest and most dangerous.</span></p>
